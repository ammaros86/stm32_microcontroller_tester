The test system consists of several components, including the Raspberry Pi and the mainboard. 
The Raspberry Pi acts as the central element and is connected to the Nucleo Board via USB and to the mainboard via a 40-pin connector. 
The mainboard serves as the primary interface, connecting all components together. An LCD display is controlled via I2C and connected through
a 4-pin connector. A current sensor is also controlled via I2C and connected through a 4-pin connector. The system includes features such as 
debouncing buttons and status indicator LEDs. Additionally, an adapter board facilitates the connection between the Nucleo Board and the mainboard.
