# STM32 Board Tester Software
The implementation of the test device software is divided into four programs:
- Board Tester Program: This software runs on a Raspberry Pi and serves as the main program for the test device.
- Mobile App Program: This is the software for the developed app to control and display test results on an Android mobile device.
- Nucleo Board Program: This program is flashed onto the Nucleo Board F303RE and enables the Raspberry Pi to control the Nucleo Board.
- PHP Files: These are used by the mobile app to access the database, including write and read operations.
